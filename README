Tools to build extract SEED data and build SEED volumes from a Nanometrics
store.  Simplified tools based on Nanometrics store tools.

Shell scripts:

docheck.sh -- run check_seed (from the GEOFON seed writer program collection)
   to check the format/data gaps in daily or monthly MSEED data.

dosort.sh -- when MSEED packets are extracted from store files, they are not
   guaranteed to be in ascending time sequence.  This script decodes the time
   stamp of each blockette and uses it to sort the blockettes into ascending
   time order.  This data stream should subsequently be split into smaller,
   hour long or day long files of blockettes for archiving and retrieval.

dropblock.sh -- copy a file of MSEED blocks to standard output, leaving out
   a list of block numbers (counting from 1 as the first block).  This is
   principally to leave out duplicated blocks when the datalogger loses power
   and restarts, losing track of what buffered data it had already flushed.

chkdays.sh -- After all data extracted and cut into day files, this script will
   take a set of file names and check that they represent continuous times.
   Reports any gaps > 1 day.  Checks are based only on file names, not the
   data contained in them.

calcpos.sh -- read in a series of GPS positions (usually from the SOH log of
   the datalogger) and find a robust location for the station.  Based on Jim
   Fowler's methodology in the PASSCAL program "position".

Programs:

tv2mseed.c -- Program to read a Taurus V2.x store file collection and strip
   out all Nanometrics protocol data packets or SOH information, turning them
   into MSEED.  This does not use the Apollo Java servers to extract data.  The
   MSEED blockette streams are separated into files for each component.  Use
   splitseed to subdivide into hourly or daily files.  If a leap second occurs
   during the lifetime of the store, and it is specified when the program is
   run, MSEED packets across the leap second will be suitably flagged.

tv3mseed.c -- Program to read a Taurus V3.x store file collection and strip out
   all Nanometrics protocol data packets or SOH information, turning them into
   MSEED.  This does not use the Apollo Java servers to extract data.  The
   MSEED blockette streams are separated into files for each component.  Use
   splitseed to subdivide into hourly or daily files.  If a leap second occurs
   during the lifetime of the store, and it is specified when the program is
   run, MSEED packets across the leap second will be suitably flagged.

mseedsort.f -- Program to read MSEED blockettes and write out start time of the
   data in each.  Use to check blockette time sequence and to unscramble
   out-of-sequence blockettes, which the Taurus will sometimes write (strange,
   but true).

splitseed.f -- Program to read a SEED volume and extract the data blocks in
   it, spreading each data block into a separate file depending on the
   component name.  This is an alternate way to get data out of a NMX store,
   first by making a large SEED request and then splitting it up into separate
   data streams.

mseedtime.f -- Program to read an MSEED file and print out the station name,
   location ID, channel name, and start time of the first sample in the file.
   Used to build non-conflicting file names for the data pool used by the
   GEOFON SEED writer program copy_seed.

rnmseed.f -- Program to rename an MSEED file to a format that reflects the
   first data time in the file.  Used to build non-conflicting file names
   for the data pool used by the GEOFON SEED writer program copy_seed.

tv[23]msleapfix.f -- Program to fix time problems caused by Taurus v[23].x
   software when satellites start broadcasting upcoming leap second.  Changes
   mseed blockette time stamps to account for datalogger software bug.

check_mseed.py -- Obspy-based Python program to check a string of files
   representing continuous data for gaps/overlaps.

Obsolete programs:

masspos.f -- Program to read a reformatted environment .csv file (from the
   standard input) to make a SAC file with the the mass positions in it.
   (Superseded by tv[23]mseed, which can extract the information as MSEED.)

Data:

leapseconds -- A file containing leap seconds; used by doextract-orig.sh to
   determine correct duration of daily requests.  Newer version of doextract.sh
   does not need it.
