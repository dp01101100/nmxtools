Use of scripts with the Apollo / Apollo-lite program from Nanometrics.

doextract.sh -- query the NMX apollo program to extract daily or monthly MSEED
   files.  This produces MSEED with a block size of 512 bytes.  To reformat
   into bigger blocks for use of the MSEED with the GEOFON SEED writer program,
   copy_seed, use the make_qseed program.  File names given to this must be
   full path names.

dogetpos.sh -- query the NMX apollo program to get hourly GPS positions from
   the store to determine average station position.  With the -p flag, meant
   to be used in conjunction with the PASSCAL 1.9 program "position" to
   determine the station latitude, longitude and elevation.

Useful notes:

1) Apollo must be running on port 8080 for the shell scripts to be useful.  To
start apollo, run it like so:

   apollo port=8080

2) The store data files must be WRITEABLE by Apollo.  That means you must
permission them when you make your local copies, or that you must run apollo
as root(!)  I prefer the former.  Also, any .log files in the directory that
contains the 'store' directory must also be writeable, and the directory must
be writeable as well.

3) When you mount Taurus data media on your local computer, it must be mounted
as an EXT2 file system.  Under MacOSX you will need to have an EXT2 reader;
MacFUSE is the best one going at this time.  When you mount, if you
will find that the mount fails, you must do an fsck of the file system before
it will successfully mount (use the fsck_ext2 program).  Finally, note that
under Tiger, an automatic mount may fail even on a clean file system.  However a
manual mount from the command line may work.  Thus, issue

   diskutil mount /dev/diskXsY

to mount the disk slice on /Volumes.  If you don't know what device your media
is attached to, use "diskutil list" or Apple's Disk Utility/Disk First Aid to
locate the device name (the X and Y in /dev/diskXsY).
